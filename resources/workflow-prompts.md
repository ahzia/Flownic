Create a workflow that:
1. Triggers when the user presses Cmd+Shift+S (or Ctrl+Shift+S on Windows)
2. Extracts the text content from the current webpage
3. Detects the language of the page content
4. Translates it to English if not English already 
5. Generates a concise summary
6. Displays the summary result in a modal dialog

The workflow should work with content in different languages and always produce the summary in English.
