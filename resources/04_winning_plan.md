## 3. Chrome Built-in AI API Integration Strategy

### Multi-API Workflow Design:
Our approach leverages multiple Chrome built-in AI APIs in a coordinated workflow:

1. **Prompt API** → **Writer API** → **Proofreader API** → **ActionPlan**
   - User input → Generate content → Grammar check → Structured output

2. **Summarizer API** → **Translator API** → **Rewriter API**
   - Extract key points → Translate → Improve clarity

3. **Job Application Workflow** (Demo):
   - **Prompt API**: "Analyze this job posting and extract key requirements"
   - **Writer API**: "Generate tailored cover letter based on job requirements and my CV"
   - **Proofreader API**: "Check grammar and improve professional tone"
   - **Summarizer API**: "Create bullet points of my relevant experience"

### API Usage Examples:
```javascript
// Example: Job Application Workflow
const jobAnalysis = await chrome.ai.prompt({
  input: "Analyze this job posting: " + jobContent,
  context: "Extract key requirements, skills, and company culture"
});

const coverLetter = await chrome.ai.writer({
  input: `Write a cover letter for: ${jobAnalysis.requirements}`,
  context: `My background: ${userCV}`
});

const proofreadLetter = await chrome.ai.proofreader({
  input: coverLetter,
  context: "Professional tone, formal business writing"
});
```
